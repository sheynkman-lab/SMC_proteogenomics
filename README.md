# SMC proteogenomics project 
---


## Pipeline objective
Characterize the predicted proteins at sQTL loci that are linked to CAD risks

1. Predict full-length protein isoforms from the filtered PacBio transcript isoform annotation.
2. Visualize SMC-specific isoforms that are linked to Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) on UCSC genome browser track.
